## Power-BI-Project-of-Atliq-Hardware-Company


📈 Helping AtliQ Hardware Make Smart Choices with Data 🚀

AtliQ Hardware is growing fast and wants to make better decisions to stay ahead of the competition. They asked for my help during my Codebasics bootcamp, and here's what we did.

🖥️ We Used Cool Tools:

I used special computer programs like SQL, PowerBi Desktop, Excel, and something called the DAX language to work with their data.

🧠 I Learned a Lot:

During this project, I learned how to handle data, create reports that change by themselves, and make them look nice.

💼 Business Words I Learned:

Besides the tech stuff, I also learned a lot about how businesses work. I got to know terms like pre-invoice deduction, net sales, profit, and more. It's like learning the secret language of business!

🚚 Supply Chain related understanding:

I also became an expert in supply chain terms, like Absolute error and Net error. It sounds complicated, but it's just about making sure things get where they need to be.

🌟 The Awesome Result:

Together, we made a fantastic report. AtliQ Hardware can now use it to answer important questions using their data. It's like having a superpower for making decisions!

This project showed me how powerful data can be for a business.
I would like to thank very much to Dhaval Patel sir and Hemanand Vadivel sir for making this project happen and guiding me with Power BI in such an amazing way.
