The project "Business Insights 360" involved the development of an all-encompassing solution that catered to both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce aspects of AtliQ hardware's operations. The team responsible for this undertaking successfully designed a powerful and insightful multi-view dashboard within the Power BI platform. This dashboard was customized to meet the unique needs of five critical departments within the organization: sales, finance, supply chain, executive and marketing.

The primary objective of this dashboard was to provide a comprehensive overview of the company's performance, enabling data-driven decision-making across all levels of the organization. By gaining valuable insights into sales trends, financial metrics, supply chain efficiency, marketing strategies, and product performance, AtliQ aimed to leverage this information to enhance and optimize their business processes significantly.


Together, we made a fantastic report. AtliQ Hardware can now use it to answer important questions using their data. It's like having a superpower for making decisions!

This project showed me how powerful data can be for a business.
